This repository contains a bare development environment for creating Red Alert: Unplugged on the [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) engine.

These scripts and support files wrap and automatically manage a copy of the OpenRA game engine and common files, and provide entrypoints to run development versions of the project and to generate installers for its players.

The key scripts in this SDK are:

| Windows               | Linux / macOS            | Purpose
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| make.cmd              | Makefile                 | Compiles your project and fetches dependencies (including the OpenRA engine).
| launch-game.cmd       | launch-game.sh           | Launches your project from the SDK directory.
| launch-server.cmd     | launch-server.sh         | Launches a dedicated server for your project from the SDK directory.
| utility.cmd           | utility.sh         | Launches the OpenRA Utility for your project.
| &lt;not available&gt; | packaging/package-all.sh | Generates release installers for your project.

To launch the project from the development environment you must first compile the project by running `make.cmd` (Windows), or opening a terminal in the SDK directory and running `make` (Linux / macOS).  You can then run `launch-game.cmd` (Windows) or `launch-game.sh` (Linux / macOS) to run your game.
